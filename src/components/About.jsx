        I have been working in digital art since 2019. I started my career in the film industry as a 3D Generalist, and today I work as a Game Artist and Game Designer in both 3D and 2D fields.

        In 3D, I am skilled across a broad range of areas, from modeling to animation. I have experience working in both realistic and cartoon styles, applying these to a variety of projects with success.

        On the 2D side, I specialize in UI/UX design for games, illustrations, and the creation of other game assets. I take pride in offering creative and technical solutions tailored to the unique needs of each project.
